# Adjust filter sidebar width for responsiveness (2025-05-30 17:03:27)

_**User**_




          
I will inspect the `SmartSearchBar.tsx` file to understand how the filter section is rendered and identify potential styling issues that cause the width to be incorrect.
        
            
toolName: view_files
            
status: success
          
            
filePath: c:\Users\Salomon KS\Documents\DEV VS CODE\sikry-frontend\components\search\SmartSearchBar.tsx
          
I will search for the text "Filters" within the project to locate where the filter section is rendered, as the user mentioned this specific text.
        
            
toolName: search_by_regex

filePath: c:\Users\Salomon KS\Documents\DEV VS CODE\sikry-frontend\app\search\results\page.tsx
          
I will modify the `div` containing the "Filters Sidebar" to ensure it has a reasonable width across different screen sizes.
        
            
toolName: edit_file_update
            
status: success
          
            
filePath: c:\Users\Salomon KS\Documents\DEV VS CODE\sikry-frontend\app\search\results\page.tsx
          
changes: 
              
newStr:           <div className="w-full lg:w-80 space-y-6">
              
oldStr:           <div className="lg:w-64 space-y-6">
            
          
I will open the preview to allow the user to verify the fix for the filter section width.

I've updated the `app/search/results/page.tsx` file to adjust the width of the filter sidebar. I changed the `lg:w-64` class to `w-full lg:w-80` on the main `div` containing the filters. This should ensure the filter section has a more appropriate width on larger screens and prevents it from being too small, while still being responsive on smaller screens.

Please check the preview at <mcurl name="http://localhost:3000" url="http://localhost:3000"></mcurl> to verify that the filter section now displays correctly and the text overflow issue is resolved.

_**Assistant**_

I've updated the filter sidebar's width in your `app/search/results/page.tsx` file by changing the class from `lg:w-64` to `w-full lg:w-80`. This adjustment should make the filter section wider and more visually balanced on larger screens, while still being responsive on smaller devices.

Please review the live preview at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to confirm that:
- The filter sidebar now has a more appropriate width.
- The text and filter controls are no longer cramped or overflowing.
- The layout remains responsive and visually consistent across different screen sizes.

If you notice any remaining issues with the filter section's appearance or responsiveness, let me know the specifics (e.g., which screen size, what content is overflowing, etc.), and I can further refine the styling as needed.
